## 2.1.0

- Add support for `Haskell` and (some) other Standard ML languages.

### Notes

Because highlight color of bracket matches seems to be a taste that differs broadly from person-to-person, built-in support was not added for it.

If you'd prefer your bracket matches highlighted with a noticable color, add the following to your User Settings (adjusting the colors to your own taste):

```json
{
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "editorBracketMatch.background": "#ff79c680",
        "editorBracketMatch.border": "#ff00ff"
    }
}
```

## 2.0.1

### Patch

---

## 2.0.0

The theme has been completely overhauled in accordance to the new [Dracula Theme Specification RFC](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/issues/232) that I put together.

All languages provided by VSCode as well as `GraphQL` and `TOML` were scrutinized and have been confirmed to be spec compliant with a few exceptions (see [`known_issues.md`](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code/blob/master/known_issues.md) in this repo for details). (#38)

Please leave your comments in the RFC issue thread if you have any suggestions.

    }

## 1.8.0

### Minor

- Remove italics from JSON keys.
- Colorize JSON key-value separators
- Complete overhaul of Yaml lang to better align with JSON highlighting.
- `this`, `var`, `const`, `let`, etc.. text formatting removed.
- Various reserved words (e.g. `class`, `interface`, `type`, etc..) color switched to be uniform with other reserved words.
- Add highlighting for import aliases in JS and friends.
- Improve background color for selected symbols.
    - Read access => cyan
    - Write access => green

### Patch

- Adjust `currentFindMatchHighlight` so that it doesn't completely mask comments. HT: @nguyenhuumy (#11)

### Chore

### Notes

The goal of the next several upcoming updates is to improve the uniformity of semantic highlighting between languages. I find it personally disorienting when using one language that has cyan as the color for types and then switch to another where it is green. The experience should be seamless across all languages.

I've [opened an issue on github](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code/issues/12) for this process. Your feedback is welcomed and encouraged!
